This repository contains Godot project, to test regression with engine.  

It creates and add to scene every single node.

For now it use only nodes with default parameters(they are add instantly after creating - add_node(Sprite.new())), but it should add as much parameters as possible.

Project shouldn't use too much randomize functions, because reproducing bugs would be a madness.
