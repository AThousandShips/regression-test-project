## Godot regression test project
This repository contains Godot project which aims to be tested in official Godot repository.

Due using by Godot Vulkan API, it is not currently possible to run editor or project inside CI(either it's and this).

Godot 3.2 uses GLES 2/3 which are available in CI, so project for this branch is developed here https://github.com/qarmin/RegressionTestProject/tree/3.2.

## Contributions 
Contributions are welcome.

Main development are for now focused in 3.2 branch of this project and there you should look at the code and write a new one or fix old one.

But still I will add some small(or maybe even big) code pieces to master branch, but since it need to be manually checked and run, it may take some time before I merge it to master branch.

## Epilepsy Warning
Due using by project a lot of functions from each type of Node, screen may flicker, images and objects may change randomly color and size which may lead some users to health problems.
